 armwrestler Evgenii Prudnik from Ukraine.</p>
        - Since March 2005. 14 years. During this time, I won six world championships, and I have more than 100 medals in total.
<br />
There is some confusion with your anthropometric data, let's clarify, what are your current biceps, forearm, and total weight indicators?
<br />
- Maximum biceps size was 49 cm and weight was 108 kg. The forearm is about 47. I always have a forearm that is almost level with the biceps.
<br />
 Did you practice any kind of sport before armwrestling, and if so, how long?
<br />
- Since childhood, he was engaged in acrobatics, from 6 to 9 years. From 9 to 11 in swimming. From 11 to 15 - judo. Complied with the standards of the candidate of master of sports in swimming, but I didn’t get documents. I won the military training competition already in high school, although I was engaged in swimming in my childhood. In judo, I won regional competitions, but did not get to a high level, because I switched to learning. And all this time since childhood I worked on the horizontal bars. Dad showed me different exercises when I was a child, but I didn’t have the strength at that time, and when I did, he explained the tricks right on me.
<br />
 What pushed you to armwrestling? As far as is known, it was at the university.
<br />
- I moved to study in Dnepropetrovsk and just went to the gym. There was a guy who was involved in weightlifting, then it was together with armwrestling. The guys arranged armwrestling competitions between faculties, and my colleague from the faculty invited me to fight. In my childhood I also tried to pull like everyone else after watching Sylvester Stallone: ​​I was 9 years old, and I pulled with a 15-year-old boy. Everyone was cheering for me, but it seemed to us that we could not move from the spot. I remembered how Stallone made a “cobra” at the movie, and I thought that I had to do the same, but I just opened and closed my fingers and I won! Although then it seemed that I had done just such move as Stallone, and it gave me strength. So, at the competition of the faculty there were three categories, and in one of them the champion of Ukraine in armwrestling pulled, and in the second, another guy who was also in armwrestling, and I won him. And I was also surprised that the champion of Ukraine beat a guy who was twice his size. It seemed to me that he was made of iron, could not believe that he was so strong. A couple of months later I was invited to more serious competitions, I trained for a week before them. Then he took third place in the championship area. Then I had a weight of 78 kg. And on the Ukrainian nationals I came third too! But I thought that it was undeserved, and I got on easy rivals. So I went through the first season in the sport.
